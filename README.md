# Real-Time Health Data Processing and Enrichment

This project provides a step-by-step roadmap to develop a solution that ingests and processes simulated real-time health data (e.g., heart rate, steps, sleep patterns) from wearable devices or fitness trackers. The solution enriches this data with relevant external knowledge using an LLM-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, leveraging **Pathway pipelines** and **Pathway vector store**. The embeddings are created using the **Ollama model**, ensuring the insights remain up-to-date and actionable.

## Features
- Simulates real-time health data for wearable devices to support agile development.
- Enriches wearable data with synthetic or publicly available mock EHR data (e.g., related to diabetes or hypertension).
- Implements an LLM-based RAG system to retrieve external knowledge from a Pathway vector store.
- Uses **Pathway pipelines** for continuous data updates and processing.

## Roadmap

### 1. **Simulate Wearable Data**
   - Generate mock data for wearables (e.g., heart rate, steps, and sleep patterns).
   - Use data generation tools or libraries to simulate realistic data streams for development and testing.

### 2. **Integrate Mock EHR Data**
   - Enrich wearable data by integrating synthetic or publicly available mock EHR datasets.
   - Use data related to specific health conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension, to contextualize insights.

### 3. **Set Up Pathway Pipelines**
   - Configure **Pathway pipelines** to handle real-time data ingestion and seamless processing of wearable and EHR data.
   - Ensure pipelines are optimized for scalability and real-time performance.

### 4. **Utilize Pathway Vector Store**
   - Deploy the **Pathway vector store** to store embeddings for efficient retrieval.
   - Use **Ollama models** to create embeddings based on the ingested data and external knowledge sources.

### 5. **Implement LLM-Based RAG Approach**
   - Design a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that integrates:
     - Pathway vector store for embedding retrieval.
     - LLM (via the Ollama model) to generate insights by combining real-time data and retrieved knowledge.
   - Ensure that the architecture supports seamless updates to both embeddings and external knowledge.

### 6. **Ensure Continuous Updates**
   - Leverage Pathway's capabilities to handle real-time updates and keep insights current.
   - Plan for noisy data handling and implement mechanisms to maintain system stability and efficiency.

### 7. **Address Challenges**
   - Incorporate strategies for scaling the solution to accommodate larger datasets.
   - Implement real-time monitoring and optimization for latency and performance.
   - Maintain data privacy and security, especially if integrating sensitive health data.
